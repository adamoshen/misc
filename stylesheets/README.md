`rmd.css`: For use with R Markdown and Quarto HTML if the HTML file will be viewed on mobile
devices. When viewing long horizontal code on a mobile device, the background of the code block does
not cover the entirety of the code.

Without `rmd.css`:

![Before rmd.css](./img/before-rmd-css.png)

With `rmd.css`:

![After rmd.css](./img/after-rmd-css.png)

*The difference is not visible if your screen is large enough such that you don't need to scroll
horizontally to view all the code.*
